# Strategy
1: Do daily transactions to stay active on testnet

2: Interact with the ecosystem projects like Kinza finance, noastra finance, opensea, haha wallet, phantom wallet, backpack, owlto, nft mints etc..

3: Kaito and discord interaction, recently berachain and story protocol gave airdrops based on kaito interactions and smart followers, try to boost your X profile and interact more and more, also be active on discord and grab roles..

4: The best thing that I like ðŸ˜‚ is to be active on our telegram channel where we provide all the latest updates.
